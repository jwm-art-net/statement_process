# sample categories
#   this file lists categories and patterns used to
#   match a transaction to a category. the pattern is
#   a regular expression and is checked against the
#   transaction description.
#
#   a category name starts at the beginning of a line.
#   a pattern immediately follows on the line below and
#   must be indented by one or more spaces from the start
#   of the line. each category must be followed by a blank
#   line before a new category begins.
#
#   here, the categories follow a similar format to GNU
#   cash (for example... I'm not completely familiar with
#   finance software yet).
#
#   comments are made by starting the line with a hash (#)
#   symbol. comments can be indented. comments cannot be
#   tagged onto the end of category name lines or pattern
#   lines.
#
#   oh and btw, patterns are regex, and precedence goes
#   from the top to the bottom of this file.
