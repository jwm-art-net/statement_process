statement_process
=================

statement_process is a Linux command line program to read PDF statements 
downloaded from online banking systems and output the transactions in a 
readable format for open source financial software.

Initial processing of the PDF statements must be performed by the pdf2text
program. statement_process can then read the text file produced and outputs
in a suitable format, ie QIF to begin with (but not yet implemented).


Beginning
=========

Currently the program can read UK HSBC personal account statements* and
Natwest personal account statements once they have been converted to text
by pdf2text. The statements are read and the balance is calculated and
matches the balances shown in the statement. The program will then output
a basic QIF structure.


*Note: HSBC statements can only be downloaded as PDF files by using
the print-to-file option of your web browser, ie Firefox.


Development
===========

I am writing the program for my partner and myself. The primary goal is 
to get it working for *us*, *before* you. This means there will be 
localization issues if you are outside of the UK. It also means it will 
not support any other banking systems until the program is fully 
operational for HSBC and Natwest statements.


TODO
====

* fully read multiline transaction descriptions for Natwest statements
* auto-categorize transactions based on categories listed in a file.
