statement_process
=================

statement_process is a Linux command line program to read PDF statements 
downloaded from online banking systems and output the transactions in a 
readable format for open source financial software.

Initial processing of the PDF statements is performed by the pdf2text 
program. statement_process then reads the text file produced and outputs 
in a suitable format, ie QIF to begin with.


Beginning
=========

Currently the program can read UK HSBC statements, and partially read UK 
Natwest statements. HSBC statements can be read and balances calculated 
after each transaction with the result of the final calculation 
matching the "balance carried forward".

It cannot yet output the data in a format readable by financial 
software.


Development
===========

I am writing the program for my partner and myself. The primary goal is 
to get it working for *us*, *before* you. This means there will be 
localization issues if you are outside of the UK. It also means it will 
not support any other banking systems until the program is fully 
operational for HSBC and Natwest statements.
