statement_process
=================

statement_process is a Linux command line program to read PDF statements
downloaded from online banking systems and output the transactions in a 
readable format for open source financial software.

statement_process uses pdftotext to convert PDF documents into plain text
before conversion to ie QIF format. pdftotext must be in the user's path.

Beginning
=========

Currently the program can read UK HSBC personal account statements* and
Natwest personal account statements. The statements are read and the
balance is calculated and matches the balances shown in the statement.
The program will then output a basic QIF structure.

Error handling is rudimentary.


Development
===========

I am writing the program for my partner and myself. The primary goal is 
to get it working for *us*, *before* you. This means there will be 
localization issues if you are outside of the UK. It also means it will 
not support any other banking systems until the program is fully 
operational for HSBC and Natwest statements. It may well be I could
also find the program too boring/demanding/unrewarding to continue
to develop.


TODO
====

* learn how to use finance software to find out what other information
  might be required in the output.

* include other mainstream companies in the sample_categories_uk
  file.


*Note: HSBC statements can only be downloaded as PDF files by using
the print-to-file option of your web browser, ie Firefox.
